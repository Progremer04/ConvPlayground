Awesome 👏 — since your project is now a **website** built entirely in HTML + Canvas for visualizing 2D convolution, here’s a clean, professional, and copy-ready **README.md** you can drop right into your GitHub repo:

---

```markdown
# 🎨 ConvPlayground

**ConvPlayground** is an interactive **web tool** that helps you **visualize and understand 2D convolution operations** — the mathematical foundation of **image processing** and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**.

Built entirely with **HTML5 Canvas** and **Vanilla JavaScript**, this tool lets you paste a matrix and a kernel (filter), then instantly see how convolution works step-by-step.

---

## 🚀 Live Demo

👉 **[Open ConvPlayground in your browser](https://yourusername.github.io/ConvPlayground/)**  
*(Replace with your GitHub Pages URL once you publish it!)*

---

## 🧠 What It Does

- 🧩 Paste any **input matrix** and **filter**
- 🎞️ Animate the **kernel sliding** over the input
- 🔢 View **step-by-step calculations**
- 📊 See the **final feature map** generated
- 💡 Perfect for **students**, **educators**, and **AI beginners**

---

## 🧮 Example

**Input Matrix**
```

1 2 3 0
0 1 2 3
3 1 0 2
2 3 2 1

```

**Filter**
```

1 0
0 -1

```

**Output**
```

1 2 3
-1 0 2
1 1 0
